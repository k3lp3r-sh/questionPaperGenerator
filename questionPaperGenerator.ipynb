      "Hydrogen exhibits properties similar to both alkali metals and halogens. Which of the following statements accurately reflects this duality?\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Hydrogen only resembles alkali metals in its ability to lose an electron and form positive ions.\n",
      "(b) Hydrogen resembles halogens only in forming diatomic molecules and covalent compounds.\n",
      "(c) Hydrogen's ability to lose an electron (like alkali metals) and gain an electron (like halogens) is a key reason for its unique reactivity.\n",
      "(d) Hydrogen resembles alkali metals in its high ionization enthalpy and halogens in forming oxides, halides, and sulfides.\n",

      "(a) Hydrogen molecules are always polar, whereas chlorine molecules are non-polar under all circumstances.\n",
      "(b) Hydrogen molecules readily form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, whereas chlorine molecules cannot.\n",
      "(c) Both are non-polar molecules due to their symmetrical diatomic structure.\n",
      "(d) Hydrogen molecule is non-polar because of equal sharing of electrons, whereas a chlorine molecule may exhibit induced polarity under external influences.\n",

      "\n",
      "Under what extreme condition can hydrogen exhibit metallic behavior?\n",

      "(a) Extremely low temperatures, approaching absolute zero.\n",
